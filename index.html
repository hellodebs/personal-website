        Hi, I'm Debora and I'm going to be a software developer. I love digital
        crafting, because it provides satisfaction and also it like learning a
        foreign language. I have been working in the hospitality for more than
        11 years before I started a new path as an office manager in a digital
        company.
        <br />
        After thinking about my future I decided to start something in a
        complete different field and to lay down the thought that it's too late
        to learn new things.
        <br />
        And here I am, attending a bootcamp to become a developer. It's not easy, I have to say, but it's fun!
        <br />
