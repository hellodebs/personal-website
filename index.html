      <p>
        Hi, I'm Debora and I'm going to be a software developer. I love digital
        crafting, because it provides satisfaction and also it like learning a
        foerign language. I have been working in the hospitality for more than
        11 years bevor I started a new path as an office manager in a digital
        company.
